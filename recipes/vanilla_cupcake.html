    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vanilla cupcakes are a beloved classic in the world of baking, known for their light and fluffy texture and rich vanilla flavor. These individual-sized cakes are made from a batter that combines flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, resulting in a moist and tender crumb. Each cupcake is typically topped with a generous swirl of vanilla buttercream frosting, which adds a creamy sweetness that complements the cake perfectly. Vanilla cupcakes are incredibly versatile and can be decorated with sprinkles, fruits, or other embellishments, making them a popular choice for parties, celebrations, and everyday treats. Their simple yet delicious taste makes them a favorite among both children and adults.</p>
