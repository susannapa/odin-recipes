    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Panna cotta is an Italian dessert that translates to "cooked cream." It is a simple yet sophisticated dessert made by simmering together cream, milk, and sugar, mixing this with gelatin, and letting it set in a mold. The mixture is infused with vanilla, which gives it a fragrant aroma and delicate flavor. Panna cotta has a smooth, creamy texture that melts in the mouth and can be paired with a variety of toppings, such as fresh berries, fruit sauces, or caramel. It's a versatile dessert that is both light and satisfying, often served chilled, making it a refreshing end to any meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
